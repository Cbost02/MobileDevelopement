# Software Development for Mobile Devices
Projects that were constructed with Kotlin, Swift, &amp; Java Programming Languages via Android Studio &amp; XCode


Don't download the project directly from github, you need to clone it, to do this, in the project repository in github click "code" than copy the link that ends with "git" , in Android studio head to File->New->Project from Version Control and past the link there, this way you will clone the project with it's original configuration, and you wont need to do much configuration
